# Data Analysis and Streamlit Dashboard Project

This project contains the data analysis performed on the air quality dataset, as well as a Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization of the results.

## Structure

This repository contains the following files:
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for analysis (in CSV format).
- **Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with all the analysis steps.
- **Python Script**: A Python script (`.py`) for running the Streamlit dashboard.
- **Requirements**: A `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary libraries for the project.
- **README**: This markdown file explaining how to run the project.

## How to Run the Dashboard

### 1. Install the Required Libraries
First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Streamlit Dashboard
To launch the Streamlit dashboard, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

This will start a local web server, and you will be able to interact with the dashboard via your web browser.

### 3. Explore the Notebook
You can also explore the data analysis steps in the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`). Open it with Jupyter or any compatible notebook viewer.
